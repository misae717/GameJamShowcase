A voice—distorted, almost human—begs for your help. It is the last experiment, a half-formed being that wants to be completed. As you search for answers, you solve puzzles to collect VHS tapes left by scientists, each revealing fragments of the truth. After uncovering everything, you must make a final moral choice: help the creature evolve, destroy it, or leave it incomplete and suffering.",
